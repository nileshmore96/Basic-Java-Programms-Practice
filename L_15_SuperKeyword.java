Super Keyword:

        Super keyword is used to refer the instance of global variable declared in the super/parent class.
        Super keyword is always used in the non-static method. We canâ€™t use super keyword in static
        methods. Super keyword is used for non-static global variable. To use static global variable we have
        to follow static approach.

The super keyword refers to superclass (parent) objects.

1.  It is used to call superclass methods, and to access the superclass constructor.
2.  The most common use of the super keyword is to eliminate the confusion between superclasses
    and subclasses that have methods with the same name.
3.  To understand the super keyword, you should have a basic understanding of Inheritance and Polymorphism.
