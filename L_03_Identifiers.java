        Rules for Identifiers in Java

        1. A valid identifier must have characters [A-Z] or [a-z] or numbers [0-9], and underscore(_)
           or a dollar sign ($).

        2. Java identifiers are case-sensitive.

        3. There should not be any space in an identifier.

        4. An identifier should not contain a number at the starting.

        5. An identifier should be of length 4-15 letters only. However, there is no limit on its length.

        6. We can't use the Java reserved keywords as an identifier such as int, float, double, char, etc.

        7. An identifier should not be any query language keywords such as SELECT, FROM, COUNT, DELETE, etc.
