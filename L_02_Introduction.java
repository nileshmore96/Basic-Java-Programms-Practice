1.  Java :-  Java is a high level, class based, Platform-independent, object-oriented and secure programming language.
         Java was developed by Sun Microsystems in the year 1995. James Gosling is known as the father of Java.
         Before Java, its name was Oak. Since Oak was already a registered company,
         so James Gosling and his team changed the Oak name to Java

2.  What is JAVA Platform?

    Any hardware or software environment in which a program runs is known as a platform. Since Java
    has a runtime environment (JRE) and API, it is called a platform.

3.  Applications of JAVA?

    1. Desktop Applications such as acrobat reader, media player, antivirus, etc.
    2. Web Applications such as irctc.co.in, javatpoint.com, etc.
    3. Enterprise Applications such as banking applications.
    4. Mobile
    5. Embedded System
    6. Smart Card
    7. Robotics
    8. Games, etc

4.  What are the feature/buzzwords of JAVA?

    1. Simple : Java is very easy to learn. Its syntax mainly based on C++.

    2. Object oriented : Java is object oriented programming language in which everything is an object.
       Object oriented programming means software development and maintenance in terms of some
       predefined rules. There are six main pillars of Java. Objects, Class, Inheritance, Polymorphism,
       Abstraction and Encapsulation.

    3. Platform Independent: Java is platform independent language. That means it can be run on
       different platforms such as windows, Linux, Mac Os etc. Java has two components, Runtime
       Environment and API (Application Programming Interface). Java code is compiled by the java
       compiler and converted it into bytecode. This byte code is platform independent hence java is
       platform independent language.

    4. Portable: As we can carry the bytecode to another platform and run it on other platform. Hence
       it is also portable in nature.

    5. Secured: Java is secured language due to it doesnâ€™t have explicit pointer and it also run inside the
       virtual machine sandbox.

    6. Dynamic: Java supports the dynamic loading of classes. That is classes are loaded on demand. It
       also supports dynamic compilation and automatic memory management.
